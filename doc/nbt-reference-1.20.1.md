# NBT documentation for 1.20.1
This document will hopefully aid the development of data fixers for the upgrade from 1.20.1 to 1.21.1 or later.
The goal is to document all NBT data structures, especially those for items, but also anything that might reference
item data, such as block/entity inventories, or the lens that last affected a mana burst.

## Botania Items
Items are listed in the order they are encountered in `BotaniaItems`, skipping those that need no special treatment beyond what Minecraft would do for items anyway. (e.g. vanilla tool, weapon, or armor data)
- LexicaBotaniaItem (`botania:lexicon`):
  - `botania:elven_unlock` (boolean) - whether to render it with the alternate Elven look

- LensItem (the various mana spreader lenses):
  - `color` (int) - DyeColor index for the lens color; -1 resolves to white, 16 for rainbow effect (which should probably become a separate value to not stand in the way of mods that add dye color)
  - `compositeLens` (compound) - serialized ItemStack containing the second lens item of a composite lens
- GrassSeedsItem (pasture seeds and its variations):
  - no NBT data
  - TODO: Is the BlockSwapper persisted? (it doesn't seem so)

  - `lastFlowers` (list of string) - IDs of recently consumed flowers (most-recent first)
  - `lastFlowerTimes` (int) - number of repetitions of the previous flower type (for repetition penalty)
